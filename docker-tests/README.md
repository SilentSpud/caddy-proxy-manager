# Docker integration test suite

A complete, self-contained caddy-proxy-manager deployment on an isolated Docker
network, driven from a separate client container that exercises the proxy the
way a real user would — over DNS, TLS, HTTP, WebSockets, and raw TCP/UDP.

Nothing here mocks anything. The Caddy under test is the project's own image,
the web app is the project's own image, certificates are issued by a real ACME
server over a real HTTP-01 challenge, and every assertion is made from outside
the system, over the wire.

```bash
./run.sh
```

The first run builds Caddy from source with its plugin set and can take several
minutes. Afterwards a full pass is a couple of minutes.

A full `./run.sh --sync` is currently 389 assertions, all green. Its first run
was not — see [What the rig has caught](#what-the-rig-has-caught).

## What the rig looks like

Everything lives on one bridge network, `172.28.0.0/24`, declared
`internal: true` — the containers can reach each other and nothing else. No host
ports are published. That restriction is not incidental: it is what proves the
certificate tests are talking to the in-network CA rather than quietly reaching
a public one, and the suite asserts the isolation before it asserts anything
else.

| Container    | Address       | Role                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `certgen`    | `172.28.0.4`  | one-shot: mints the rig's fixed PKI, then exits              |
| `dns`        | `172.28.0.5`  | dnsmasq — `*.cpm.test` → Caddy, everything else → Docker DNS |
| `caddy`      | `172.28.0.10` | **system under test** — the project's Caddy image            |
| `web`        | `172.28.0.11` | **system under test** — the project's CPM image              |
| `web-slave`  | `172.28.0.13` | second CPM instance (`--sync` only), Caddy in the same netns |
| `origin-a`   | `172.28.0.20` | L7 HTTP origin                                               |
| `origin-b`   | `172.28.0.21` | L7 HTTP origin, second identity for load-balancing tests     |
| `origin-tls` | `172.28.0.22` | L7 HTTPS origin with a deliberately mismatched certificate   |
| `origin-tcp` | `172.28.0.23` | L4 TCP echo — no HTTP awareness at all                       |
| `origin-udp` | `172.28.0.24` | L4 UDP echo                                                  |
| `pebble`     | `172.28.0.30` | ACME certificate authority                                   |
| `runner`     | `172.28.0.40` | **simulated client** — the only container that runs tests    |

### The destinations

caddy-proxy-manager proxies at two layers, and the rig provides a destination
for each:

- **Layer 7** — `origin-a`, `origin-b` and `origin-tls` speak HTTP. They reflect
  the request back as JSON: the `Host` they were given, every header the proxy
  added, the address the connection came from, the body. That is what lets a
  test assert *how* a request was proxied, not merely that it arrived.
- **Layer 4** — `origin-tcp` and `origin-udp` are byte-level echo servers with
  no notion of HTTP. They exist so the stream proxy can be tested for what it
  actually is: a socket relay, with no request/response framing to lean on.

All five are one small standard-library Python script
(`images/backend/server.py`) run in different modes.

### Certificates

There is no route to Let's Encrypt, so the rig runs [Pebble][pebble] as its CA
and CPM is pointed at it through the ACME settings the product already exposes
(`caUrl` + `caRootPem`). Pebble is told to validate challenges on ports 80 and
443 against Caddy, and to resolve names through the same dnsmasq the client
uses. Certificate issuance in this suite is therefore a genuine ACME order with
a genuine challenge — the only thing that is fake is who signs it.

Two CAs are in play, and they are unrelated:

- `certgen` mints the CA that signs **Pebble's own HTTPS endpoint**, because
  Caddy has to trust something to talk ACME over TLS. This is what gets handed
  to CPM as `caRootPem`.
- **Pebble** generates its own issuing root at startup. The client fetches it
  from Pebble's management API during bootstrap and adds it to the trust store
  it verifies Caddy against.

## Running

```bash
./run.sh                    # everything, then tear down
./run.sh mtls l4            # only files whose name matches a pattern
./run.sh --sync             # add the second CPM instance and the replication tests
./run.sh --keep             # leave the rig up afterwards
./run.sh --shell            # a shell in the client container
./run.sh --logs caddy       # tail a service
./run.sh --down             # tear down, volumes included
./run.sh --rebuild          # rebuild images from scratch
```

Two feature areas can be switched off when they are not the point of the run:
`--no-geoblock` and `--no-waf`.

Inside the client container the suite is at `/suite`, so with `--keep` you can
iterate without restarting anything:

```bash
docker compose exec runner bash /suite/run-tests.sh 25
```

Test files are ordinary bash. Editing one on the host takes effect immediately —
`/suite` is a bind mount.

### What the rig has caught

**Forward auth never sent identity headers to the upstream.** CPM's forward auth
asks `/api/forward-auth/verify` who the user is and copies the answer onto the
upstream request as `X-CPM-User`, `X-CPM-Email`, `X-CPM-Groups` and
`X-CPM-User-Id`. The verify endpoint returned all four correctly; Caddy copied
none of them. The generated `handle_response` block read each value back through
`{http.reverse_proxy.header.X-CPM-User}`, and that placeholder does not
resolve — Go canonicalises the stored header key to `X-Cpm-User`, and Caddy
indexes the map with the literal name from the placeholder. Probing the running
config from inside the rig showed `{http.reverse_proxy.header.X-Cpm-User}`
returning the username while the all-caps spelling came back as its own literal
text. The `not vars … ""` guard around each copy then matched the empty string,
the route was skipped, and nothing was set at all — so every application behind
CPM forward auth saw an anonymous request.

Fixed in `src/lib/caddy.ts` by canonicalising the placeholder for both the CPM
and Authentik copy lists, and pinned at the unit level in
`tests/unit/caddy-forward-auth-copy-headers.test.ts`.

Two lesser things the rig documents rather than treats as bugs, both pinned so
a change to either is deliberate:

- `/api/waf-events`, `/api/geoip-status` and `/api/l4-ports` sit outside the
  session middleware's allowlist in `proxy.ts`, so a bearer token gets a 307 to
  the login page. They are UI-support endpoints, absent from the OpenAPI
  document, and each still enforces `requireApiAdmin` on its own.
- The Caddy admin API's `origins` list rejects a foreign `Origin` header but not
  a foreign `Host`: binding to an open interface makes Caddy skip Host checking
  entirely. What actually bounds reach is that port 2019 is never published.

### Known limits

- **Country, continent and ASN blocking** need MaxMind databases, which are a
  licensed download. `50-geoblock` asserts on CIDR and bare-IP rules, which go
  through the same handler and need no database. If the blocker plugin turns out
  to refuse a config without one, the file reports a skip with that reason
  rather than a failure.
- **OAuth/OIDC sign-in** would need an identity provider in the rig. The suite
  covers local credentials, bearer tokens, and forward auth; it does not cover
  the OIDC paths.
- **Authentik forward auth** would need an Authentik outpost. CPM's own forward
  auth, which shares the same route-building code, is covered end to end.
- **Analytics** (ClickHouse) is not started. `55-waf` checks that the WAF event
  endpoint answers, not that a specific event was ingested.
- The **L4 port manager** sidecar is not run. It only exists to republish host
  ports when L4 hosts change, and the client is on the same network as Caddy, so
  it reaches stream listeners directly.

## How a test file is written

Each file sources `suite/lib.sh` and runs as its own bash process, so a crash
takes down that file and nothing else. Assertions record a result and keep
going rather than aborting, so one broken feature does not hide the state of the
rest. Everything a file creates is registered for teardown on exit, including
resources left behind by a create that failed after the row was written.

```bash
. "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../lib.sh"

banner "my feature"

domain=$(domain_for "my-feature")
create_host_or_fail "a host can be created" "$(jq -nc --arg d "$domain" '{
  name: "docker-test my feature", domains: [$d], upstreams: ["origin-a:8080"]
}')" && pass "a host can be created"

wait_for_https "$domain"

fetch "https://$domain/some/path"
t_eq "the request is proxied" "200" "$FETCH_CODE"
t_eq "it reaches the right origin" "origin-a" "$(fetch_json '.origin')"

finish
```

Useful helpers, all in `suite/lib.sh`:

## Coverage

A full run ends with an API surface coverage report:

```
API surface coverage (documented operations driven over the wire)
  45/67 operations — 67%

  not exercised:
    GET    /api/v1/certificates
    PUT    /api/v1/mtls-roles/{id}
    DELETE /api/v1/sessions/{id}
    …

  exercised but not in the document:
    POST   /api/v1/users
    DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}
    POST   /api/v1/proxy-hosts/{id}/mtls-access-rules
    GET    /api/v1/dns-providers
    …
```

Line coverage is deliberately not attempted here. The application under test is
a bundled standalone server in another container; instrumenting it would mean
measuring something other than the artefact that ships. The useful question for
a black-box suite is how much of the declared REST surface it actually drove,
which is what this measures — against the running instance's own
`/api/v1/openapi.json`, so the report always describes the build under test.

Every call made through `api` or `api_session` is recorded and matched back to a
path template, so `/api/v1/proxy-hosts/42` counts towards
`/api/v1/proxy-hosts/{id}`. Calls that match no template are listed separately:
they are either endpoints missing from the OpenAPI document or a typo in a test,
and both are worth seeing.

It is a report, not a gate — `./run.sh mtls` legitimately touches less of the
surface, so a threshold would fail for the wrong reason. The report is skipped
entirely on a filtered run.

The second list is worth reading as carefully as the first. On its first run it
showed that `POST /api/v1/users`, `DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}`, the whole
`/api/v1/proxy-hosts/{id}/mtls-access-rules` path, `/api/v1/dns-providers` and
`/api/v1/oauth-providers` are all implemented and exercised but absent from the
OpenAPI document — i.e. the published API contract understates what the API
does. (`/api/geoip-status`, `/api/l4-ports` and `/api/waf-events` also appear
there, but those are UI-support endpoints and are meant to be undocumented.)

For line coverage of the server-side library and API handlers, run the unit and
integration suites instead, from the repository root:

```bash
bun run test:coverage
```

That writes `coverage/lcov.info` and enforces the ratchet thresholds in
`scripts/coverage-ratchet.ts`.

## Debugging a failure

```bash
./run.sh --keep 40-mtls          # run one file, leave the rig up
./run.sh --logs caddy            # what Caddy thought of the config
./run.sh --logs pebble           # ACME orders and challenge results
./run.sh --shell                 # poke at it from the client's point of view
```

From inside the client container, the running Caddy config is the fastest way to
see what CPM actually generated:

```bash
curl -s http://caddy:2019/config/ | jq '.apps.http.servers.cpm.routes'
```
