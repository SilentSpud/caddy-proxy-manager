/**
 * Copying a vetted legacy SQLite database into PostgreSQL.
 *
 * Four things make this more than a row-for-row copy, and all four are derived from the schema
 * rather than from a list someone has to keep in step with it:
 *
 * 1. **Order.** Foreign keys mean `accounts` cannot land before `users`. The order is a
 *    topological sort of the schema's own foreign keys, so adding a table with a new reference
 *    orders itself.
 * 2. **Booleans.** SQLite stored them as 0/1 and PostgreSQL will not accept an integer in a
 *    boolean column. The columns that need converting are read off the drizzle schema.
 * 3. **Sequences.** Rows keep their ids so foreign keys stay intact, and PostgreSQL does not
 *    advance a `serial` for an explicit id — so every sequence is resynced afterwards. Skipping
 *    this is the bug that made the first post-migration insert fail with a duplicate key.
 * 4. **Selection.** An operator can leave a group behind — most usefully the old accounts. A
 *    table nobody chose is not copied, and the references into it are resolved from the foreign
 *    keys too: a nullable one is nulled, and a table that cannot exist without its parent is
 *    dropped along with it. Neither decision is a list, so a new table gets them for free.
