/**
 * Carrying a pre-3.0 database's encrypted values across a change of `SESSION_SECRET`.
 *
 * Secrets in the old database — certificate private keys, DNS provider credentials, OAuth client
 * secrets, agent secrets, the Tailscale auth key — are ciphertext bound to the `SESSION_SECRET`
 * that installation ran with. The importer copies rows verbatim, so before this the only way to
 * read them afterwards was to adopt the old secret on the new deployment: change `SESSION_SECRET`
 * to match, restart, migrate. That is a bad trade. It makes the old value permanent, and an
 * operator who has already generated a new one has to go and find the old one anyway.
 *
 * So the old secret is asked for once, used here, and forgotten. Every encrypted value is
 * decrypted with it and re-encrypted under the key this deployment actually uses, on the way in.
 * Nothing stores it, and after the migration the old secret is of no further use to anyone.
 *
 * Two shapes have to be handled, because two shapes exist in the schema:
 *
 * - A column that *is* a secret — `certificates.privateKeyPem`, `agents.secret`.
 * - A column holding JSON with secrets inside it — the `settings` rows, where a registry secret is
 *   a JSON-encoded string and the Tailscale blob is an object with an `authKey` field.
 *
 * Both are handled by looking for the `enc:v1:` marker rather than by naming columns: the prefix is
 * already the thing every read path keys off, so a column added later is covered without anyone
 * remembering to add it to a list here.
