/**
 * What a group is allowed to manage.
 *
 * Grants are **additive and non-subtractive**: they widen what an `operator` can reach and change
 * nothing at all for an `admin`, a `user` or a `viewer`. That is the property that makes this safe
 * to ship into an existing deployment — until someone is deliberately given the operator role,
 * every row in this table is inert.
 *
 * Resources are named by one nullable column each rather than a polymorphic (type, id) pair, so
 * every reference is a real foreign key: deleting a host takes its grants with it instead of
 * leaving a row pointing at an id something else will later reuse.
