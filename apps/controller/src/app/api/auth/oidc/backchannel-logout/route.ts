/**
 * OIDC Back-Channel Logout endpoint (OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0).
 *
 * Register this URL with the identity provider as its `backchannel_logout_uri`:
 *
 *   https://<cpm>/api/auth/oidc/backchannel-logout
 *
 * One URL serves every configured provider — the token names its issuer, and that is what selects
 * the provider whose client id and signing keys it is then checked against.
 *
 * There is deliberately no CSRF or same-origin check here. The caller is the IdP's own server, not
 * a browser: there is no cookie to abuse and no origin to compare, and the signed token is the
 * whole of the authentication. Everything the request claims about itself is checked against the
 * provider row rather than taken at face value.
