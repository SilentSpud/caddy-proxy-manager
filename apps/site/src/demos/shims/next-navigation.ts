/**
 * Stands in for `next/navigation` inside the demos (see the alias in astro.config.mjs).
 *
 * DataTable is what needs it. That table sorts and pages by pushing a new URL, because in the app
 * the server does the sorting - so for the demo to be more than a picture, the query string has to
 * be somewhere a component can both write and watch. It writes to the real one, and the demo that
 * owns the rows subscribes here and re-derives them, which is the same contract with the work
 * moved into the browser.
 *
 * `replaceState`, never `pushState`: a reader pressing Back should leave the page, not undo a sort.
