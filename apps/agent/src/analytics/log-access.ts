/**
 * Whether Caddy's logs are usable by the two processes that depend on them, and saying so.
 *
 * The agent runs as its own user, reaching the logs through Caddy's group. That only works while
 * the files carry the modes and group Caddy normally gives them, and every way it stops working is
 * silent: an unreadable log parses as an empty one, a failed truncation leaves the WAF audit log
 * growing, and a directory Caddy cannot list stops its roller pruning old files. So this checks,
 * logs a warning once per problem, and reports it to the controller, which shows the fix on the
 * Agents page. Nothing here changes a permission - the agent could not, and should not try.
