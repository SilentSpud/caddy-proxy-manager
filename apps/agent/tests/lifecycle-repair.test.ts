/**
 * An agent the controller has forgotten must find its way back on its own.
 *
 * The bundled stack keeps the agent's pairing on its own volume, so a controller rebuilt with a
 * fresh database answers the resumed stream with 401. The agent rightly drops the dead secret and
 * stops Caddy - but the same controller has already written a new bootstrap token, and an agent
 * that stopped watching for one would sit idle beside it forever, Caddy down, on a stack nobody
 * ever had to pair by hand. So after the 401 it must go back to watching, exactly as it does when
 * it boots with no pairing at all. An explicit `--code` is the one case that opts out: that
 * operator is pairing by hand and a spent code must not be retried every few seconds.
