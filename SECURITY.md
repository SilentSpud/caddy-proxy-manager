## Security Measures

### Build Pipeline Security

Our CI/CD pipeline implements multiple security layers:

1. **Nothing published from a pull request**: images are built and pushed by one workflow
   (`docker-build-trusted.yml`). A pull request - from a fork or otherwise - runs the test and
   end-to-end suites and never touches the registry, so there is no build-and-push path for
   untrusted code to reach.
2. **Only a release tag on `main` publishes**: `release.yml` tags a release when `package.json`'s
   version changes on `main`, then dispatches the image build at that tag. The build's first job
   refuses any ref that is not a `vX.Y.Z` tag whose commit is reachable from `main`, so a manual
   dispatch on a branch publishes nothing. Anyone who can push tags can still start a build, but
   only of a commit that already landed on `main`.
3. **`latest` follows prereleases, for now**: `docker-compose.yml` runs `:latest`, and 3.0.0 has
   only release candidates, so the newest prerelease moves `latest`. Once a stable `v3` tag exists,
   only stable releases move it. Re-dispatching an older tag republishes its own version tags but
   never moves `latest`, `3` or `3.0` back. To avoid tracking `latest` at all, deploy from the
   release archive, which pins the three images to that release.
4. **Pinned inputs**: every GitHub Action is pinned to a full commit SHA, every base and third-party
   image to a tag and digest, and CI's Bun to the version the images build with. The agent image
   pins `docker-ce-cli` and `docker-compose-plugin` to a major version only, because Docker's apt
   repository drops old builds.
5. **Automated pull requests**: Dependabot proposes the bumps above. `caddy-compatibility-pins.yml`
   opens its pull request with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which starts no workflow, so the test and end-to-end
   checks do not run on it until a maintainer closes and reopens it or pushes to its branch.
6. **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials is generated for all builds
7. **Provenance Attestation**: Build provenance is recorded for supply chain security
8. **Limited Permissions**: Workflows use minimal required permissions. The test workflow declares
   `permissions: {}`, so its `GITHUB_TOKEN` carries no scopes, and it references no repository secrets

### Container Security

- Multi-architecture builds (linux/amd64 and linux/arm64)
- Base images pinned by digest, with weekly Dependabot updates for all three Dockerfiles and the
  images `docker-compose.yml` runs
- Web, Caddy and the agent run as their own non-root users
- **Networks follow who needs whom.** `caddy-network` holds Caddy, web, the agent (for egress) and
  the upstreams you attach. Caddy's admin API, PostgreSQL and ClickHouse each sit on an internal
  network (`caddy-admin`, `database`, `analytics`) shared only with the containers that use them,
  so a container attached to be proxied reaches none of them. `geoipupdate` has only the default
  network, for egress to MaxMind.
- `/acme-ca`, which decides the CA Caddy trusts for ACME, is owned by web's user with mode `0755`,
  and Caddy mounts it read-only. A volume created by an earlier release keeps its old `0777` mode
  until tightened by hand; the README's upgrade notes show how.

### The Agent Is Root on Its Host

The agent recreates Caddy and starts ClickHouse and `geoipupdate` through the Docker API, which it
reaches only through `docker-socket-proxy`. That proxy allows containers, images, volumes, networks
and builds, with `POST`, and denies exec, swarm, secrets, auth, events and everything else.

**Treat the proxy as narrowing the API, not as a boundary.** It matches URL prefixes and never sees
a request body, so the same `POST /containers/create` that recreates Caddy could ask for a
privileged container, the host's PID namespace or `/` bind-mounted, and `PUT
/containers/{id}/archive` could write files into any container. Whatever controls the agent, or can
reach the proxy, is root on that host.

The controls that matter are therefore:

- **The agent validates what it is told.** Desired state from the controller is checked on the
  agent before it reaches Docker: published ports, Caddy module paths, the environment variables a
  managed service may receive, and GeoIP edition names. Caddy admin calls pass a path allowlist.
- **The agent stays minimal.** Its image holds the compiled agent, the Docker CLI and the Compose
  plugin, and it is the only container on the proxy's internal network.
- **The agent does not read `.env`.** It mounts the compose directory read-only to run Compose, but
  passes `--env-file /dev/null` and placeholders for `SESSION_SECRET` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and
  gets the variables its services need from its own environment. Keep `.env` at mode `0600`.
  Anything else in that directory that other users can read - an override file, `.git` - the agent
  can read.

### Caddy Module Builds

**Settings → Caddy Build** lets an admin choose which plugins Caddy is compiled
with, and add their own. Two consequences are worth stating plainly:

- **Custom modules are arbitrary code in the proxy.** A module added there is
  fetched from its Go module path, compiled into the Caddy binary, and runs with
  the proxy's privileges on every request. Treat adding one exactly as you would
  treat merging code into this repository. Module paths are validated against a
  strict allowlist before they reach the build (see `validateCustomModule`), so
  a path cannot inject shell into the Dockerfile - but a *valid* path to a
  malicious repository is still malicious.

- **Rebuilding needs `BUILD: 1`** on `docker-socket-proxy`, the default. Image
  builds add little to an API that is already root-equivalent (see above), but
  set `BUILD: 0` to opt out; the rest of the application is unaffected and
  images can be built by hand instead.

Only admins can reach either surface. Custom Caddy configuration is likewise admin-only, and so is
pointing an upstream at Caddy's admin port, a unix socket or a placeholder: an operator granted a
host can edit its upstreams, but not reach the admin API through it.

### First-run Setup

An installation with no accounts serves nothing but the setup flow, and that flow is necessarily
public - there is no account to authenticate against yet. **Whoever reaches a fresh deployment
first becomes its administrator.** Complete setup before the instance is reachable from anywhere
you do not control, or set `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`, which seeds an admin at startup and
skips the flow entirely.

Once setup completes the flag is stored, and the setup screens redirect away for good.

### Sign-in and Forward Auth

- **Guessing is limited by address and by account.** Dashboard and forward-auth sign-in count
  failures per client address and per username, with a backoff that doubles up to 15 minutes. The
  client address is the connection's own peer unless that peer is loopback, Caddy or a configured
  trusted proxy; `X-Real-IP` is never trusted.
- **Each derived key has one purpose.** The reachability probe on `/api/health` and the proof Caddy
  attaches to forward-auth requests are keyed separately from `SESSION_SECRET`, so no probe answer
  can stand in for the proof.
- **Changing credentials takes a fresh sign-in.** Setting a first password on a provider-only
  account needs a session under ten minutes old, unlinking a provider needs the password, and a
  password change ends the user's other sessions and forward-auth sessions. Better Auth's own
  password, profile, account and token routes are switched off in favour of the app's.

### Controller and Agent

The agent dials the controller; the controller never dials the agent. Pairing, the event stream
(`/api/agent/v1/events`, one SSE stream per agent), status reports, command results
(`POST /api/agent/v1/command-results`) and the GeoLite2 download are all agent-to-controller
requests. Configuration goes down the stream as desired state. A Caddy admin call is the one
command the controller waits on: it goes down the stream with a correlation id, and the agent posts
the answer back.

Those requests are signed rather than bearer-authenticated. Each carries an HMAC-SHA256, keyed by
the pairing secret, over the method, path, timestamp, a nonce and a hash of the body:

- **The secret never travels with a request**, so it cannot be lifted from a proxy log or a
  `curl -v` pasted into an issue.
- **The path is bound into the signature**, so a captured read cannot be replayed as a write.
- **The body is bound too**, so a valid request cannot be edited in flight.
- A ±60 second window bounds replay, and a nonce seen inside that window is refused.

**Pairing.** The agent in the controller's own stack pairs with a single-use bootstrap token the
controller leaves on its data volume. The token is written only while that agent is unpaired,
expires after 30 minutes, and is not written again after an admin unpairs the agent until
auto-pairing is switched back on. An agent on another host pairs with a six-letter code valid for
five minutes and burned on first use. Wrong guesses are limited per client address, and each code
is discarded after 200 of them. The two sides exchange a secret, which is encrypted with
`encryptSecret` before it reaches a row and is never returned to the browser, logged, or included
in any view type.

- **A pairing never replaces an existing one.** An agent id the controller already knows can only
  be paired again with a code an admin mints from that agent's row, and a disabled agent cannot
  pair at all.
- **Remote agents default to HTTPS.** A bare host name means `https://`, except loopback and
  single-label names such as `web`. Plain `http://` to a private address is allowed with a
  warning, and to a public address it is refused unless `CONTROLLER_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` is set.
- **Unpairing closes the agent's stream** and forgets the controller's side. Restart the agent as
  well if you are removing one you no longer trust.

**The agent's Caddy admin proxy is an allowlist**, not a sanitiser: `/load`, `/config/`, `/adapt`
and `/reverse_proxy/upstreams` are the four paths the controller needs. Caddy's admin API can stop
the server outright, so a request for anything else is treated as not having come from this
application, whatever signed it.

**An agent answers only for its own Caddy.** Each agent adapts Caddyfile snippets for the config
it is sent, and the health monitor re-applies config only to the agent that reported a problem. A
compromised agent can misconfigure its own Caddy, but never another agent's. A snippet is checked
against every connected agent before it is saved.

**Caddy's admin API is not on the upstream network.** The bundled compose file binds it to Caddy's
address on the internal `caddy-admin` network, which only web and the agent share, and the agent
pins that address into every config it forwards, since the controller's own `admin` block binds
every interface. A deployment without that network - an older compose file, or no agent - keeps
the open bind, where only leaving port 2019 unpublished bounds who can reach it.

**The GeoLite2 route hides itself.** Every refusal on it answers `404` - unsigned, unknown agent id,
stale timestamp, disabled agent, unknown database edition are all identical from outside, so
nothing can learn the route exists or which agent ids are real without already holding a secret.

**ClickHouse credentials travel to every agent.** Each host parses its own Caddy logs and inserts
the events itself, using credentials the controller pushes. It is the same account the controller
creates tables and reads with, not an insert-only one, so every agent host holding it can read, alter
or drop every host's analytics. The account has no access management
(`CLICKHOUSE_DEFAULT_ACCESS_MANAGEMENT: 0`), so it cannot create users or grant itself more. On a
fleet spread across hosts you do not equally trust, weigh that before turning analytics on.

**`SESSION_SECRET` is the root of all of it.** It derives the key that encrypts DNS provider
credentials, imported private keys, agent secrets and the secret settings. Rotating it makes every
one of them unreadable.

### Dependency Management

- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot: Bun packages, the Go modules compiled into Caddy,
  GitHub Actions, the three Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml`
- Security alerts enabled
- Regular security audits

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing:

1. Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials
2. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
3. Keep dependencies up to date
4. Follow principle of least privilege
5. Validate and sanitize all user inputs
6. Use parameterized queries for database operations

## Automated Security Checks

Our repository includes:

- **Dependabot** for dependency updates
- **GitHub Security Advisories** monitoring

## Reviewing a fork pull request

No workflow publishes anything from a pull request, so review is about what merging would let in
rather than what the run itself can do:

1. Review the PR code thoroughly for malicious content
2. Check for suspicious file modifications - workflow files and `docker/` especially, since those
   decide what a later release builds and pushes
3. Verify no secrets or credentials are exposed

## Upgrading

Releases after 3.0.0-rc.3 move Caddy's admin API, PostgreSQL and ClickHouse onto internal networks
and stop the agent reading `.env`. An existing Caddy container has to be replaced once, and a
`CADDY_API_URL` or an override file that interpolates variables may need changing. The README's
"Upgrading to the isolated Caddy admin API" lists the steps.

## Security Updates

Security updates are prioritized and released as soon as possible. Subscribe to repository releases to stay informed.
