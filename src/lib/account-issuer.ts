/**
 * Account namespace ("issuer") helpers for CPM's `accounts` table.
 *
 * Better Auth 1.7 namespaced external identities by `(issuer, accountId)` and
 * exposed `createLocalAccountIssuer` / `createOAuthAccountIssuer` to build those
 * synthetic issuers. Starting with Better Auth 1.7.4 the account key is
 * `(providerId, accountId)` and the issuer helpers were removed from
 * `better-auth/db`; CPM keeps its own `accounts.issuer` column for its internal
 * identity bookkeeping, so the namespace strings are computed here and are
 * deliberately identical to the values Better Auth 1.7.x produced. A provider
 * with its own issuer stays pinned to it (trusted config wins); providers
 * without one get an isolated URL-encoded synthetic namespace so they cannot
 * collide with each other or with the local credential account.
